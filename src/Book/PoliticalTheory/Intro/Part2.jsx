<p>cognitive dissonance</p>
<p>The problem with the understanding of cognitive dissonance is that many assume ti to be a name to describe the internal conflict a person has on a subject. This is inaccurate, the term is actually used to describe a case in which rationalisation occurs.</p>
<p>The application of cognitive dissonance to politics is complicated and associates with a persons ability to handle the anguish that comes with the internal conflict. This ability can come from how much a person is comfortable with the ambiguous uncertain state that leads to cognitive dissonance. Or, it can be the ability a person has to understand the components that make up the dissonance.</p>
<p>The most famous study in cognitive dissonance is by Festinger 1962?&nbsp;</p>
<p>in this study, Festinger compared two groups. both groups were forced to carry out a very time consuming, menial and pointless task. Afterwards, one group was paid a penny, much smaller than their time would have been worth. Whilst another group was given twenty pounds.</p>
<p>The results showed that the group that was the most satisfied with the job was the group that was given the penny, they stated they would like to do the task again and even found it to be fun. The other group, however, given the twenty pounds claimed the task was tedious, repetitive and not worth their time. They did not want to do the job again.</p>
<p>The anxiety and conflict are between the idea that they would not be doing a tedious task without any reward, and that they are still doing the task. This is resolved by people rationalising with how they love the work. The other group, being paid 20&pound; had a reason for doing the task&nbsp; "a lot of money," and as such, they are less likely to claim they like the work.</p>
<p>The idea is strange as if they are given the money they do not like the work as much.</p>
<p>However, is this applicable in politics?</p>
<p>Let's say there is a politician.</p>
<p>This politician is the most unfit for the role imaginable. They are very incompetent, clearly corrupt, possibly suffer from a diagnosis of narcissism, has no experience, has a record of failure etc etc.</p>
<p>However, to be a politician you believe that you would have to be highly respectable, articulate, intelligent and for you to support them, they would also have to appear to want to do what you want a president to do.</p>
<p>so if there is a person that is theoretically unstable, corrupt and with a poor track record, you would have an increased chance of cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>cognitive dissonances would take the form of "rationalisations"</p>
<p>You would assume, there is no way he could be that incompetent and also be in that position of authority. You may take the position that claims of the incompetence could not be true, are exaggerations, are a symptom of bias against the authority figure or are even made up.</p>
<p>You may fabricate greatness for the politician to accommodate for the failings the person appears to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The application of this theory to politics will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>
