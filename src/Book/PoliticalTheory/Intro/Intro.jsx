<p>One question that you can give to a person when they beleive something that is different to someone else is.<br /><div className={Style.sheader}>Why?</div></p>
<p>Asking a person why they believe somethign can inevitably lead to more questions of why, untill it ultimately comes to a conclusion that is fundamental to their very philosophy. That means everyone has a philosophy which directs their political debate if they know it or not, even if the philosophy is as simple as "because it is more efficient" "because it creates more equality" or "because it gives the best individual freedom".</p>
<p>What is important about these philosophical differences is that they can be grouped into two catagories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One which can be described as "utilitarian philosophies" and another that can be described as "entitlement" philosophies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The utilitarian philosophy is the idea that the greatest amount of wellbeing for the greatest amount should be a priority. This is normally in opposition to Kantian philosophy. However.,Utilitarian is not opposed when thinking about the most ethical way to spend yourown resorces. That is in politics, your vote is infact, your own resorce.</p>
<p>The entitlment philosophies are the philosophies associated with extreme ideologies. They are entitlments to equality, such as the idea of "basic human rights". The entitlments to individual freedoms, such as "property rights". The entitlments to culture, nationa and heritage, which can also be strenously attatched onto the individual rights.</p>
<p>A person generates their own philosophy by placing their value in a specific sense of entitlment either the entitlments to equality or the entitlments to individual rights and pushes that against the centrist globalist perspective of the greatest wellbeing for the greatest amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be used to explain how all diffrences are formed in a political divide. However, thereis the obvious argument that what if a group is just misinformed.</p>
<p>To counter this belief that it is misinformation guiding the differences, you can look at simple topics that everyone is clearly well informed on. The most obvious topic would be "inheritance tax".</p>
<p>Within inheritance tax, there is the belief that an individual should not be taxed all thir life just to be taxed after death. However, as with all beliefs if you ask why enough, it gets down to its fundamentals. In this it is the individual freedoms and rights of a person for their own property.</p>
<p>The argument for inhertiance tax though, is about crerating the greatest amount of oppertunity for the greatest amount, by stoping families from hoarding wealt. This belief also crosses over with the entitlment to equality.<br />However there is also the utilitarian perspective, that it is the most efficient way of taking income as the children who inherit the money are not proven to be good investors with the money and thus are less likely to handle it as effectively as the government or other potential sources of tax revenue.</p>
<p>Thus Inheritance tax shows that debate revolves around a sense of entitlmnt against the greater good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Extra information</em><br /><br />This point of view though simplistic is both new and counter to past research. Previous research placed political view on a libertarian to authoritarian axis. That is how much control you want to government to have and how much freedom you want.</p>
<p>The entitlment thory improved on the libertarian theory because.<br />The libertarian/authoritarian theory ignores how the same libertarian policies are grouped together with the same authoritarian policies.</p>
<p>The rightwing in the USA for example, support increased abortion laws yet do not support increased gun laws.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p>
